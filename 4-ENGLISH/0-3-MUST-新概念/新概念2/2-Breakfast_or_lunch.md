content
It was Sunday. I never get up early on Sunday. I sometimes stay in bed until lunchtime.
Last Sunday I got up very late. I looked out of the window.
It was dark outside.

"What a day!" I thought. "It's raining again."
Just then, the telephone rang. It was my aunt Lucy.

"I've just arrived by train," she said. "i'm coming to see you."

"But i'm still having breakfast," I said.

"What are you doing?" she asked.

"I'm having breakfast," I repeated.

"Dear me," she said. "Do you always get up so late? it's one o'clock!"
