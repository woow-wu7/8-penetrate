# Monster 野兽

```
monster 怪兽 怪物 巨大的
chase 赶走
lighthouse 灯塔 ( light灯 灯光 ) ( house房子 )
stare at 盯着 ( staring right at us ----- right正当，真正的 )
```

```
I see your monster, I see your pain. 我看到你心里的怪兽，看到你心里的痛苦
Tell me your problems, I'll chase them away
I'll be your lighthouse, I'll make it okay.
When I see your monsters, I'll stand there so brave, and chase them all away.

In the dark we we
We stand apart we we
Never see that the things we need are staring right at us 却不知道我们需要的东西就在眼前

You just want to hide hide 你一味的躲避
Hide never show your smile smile
Stand alone when you need someone it's the hardest thing of all 世间最难的事情是 你需要帮助时却四下无人

That you see are the bad bad
Bad memories take your time and you'll find me. 不要着急 我很快就会出现


I can see the sky, sky, sky, beautiful tonight, night
when you breathe why can’t you see the clouds are in your head 当当你仰头呼吸 只见头上乌云一片
I will stay there there, there, there, no need to fear, fear 別怕 我会在你身边
when you need to talk it out with someone you can trust 若你需要倾述 需要信任
What you see are the bad, bad, bad memories 你只看见黑暗面
take your time you’ll find it. 慢慢來 你会发现你最需要的是我
```
