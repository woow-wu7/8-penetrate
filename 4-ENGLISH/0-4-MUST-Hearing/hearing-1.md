Man: How satisfied with the service are you? Do you have any complaints?

sadie: Well, as I said, It's very convenient and quick when it's on time, but this morning it was late. Only about 10 minutes, but still.

Man: Yes, I understand that's annoying. And what about the timetable? Do you have any comments about that?

sadie: Mmm, I suppose I mainly use the bus during the day, but any time i've been in town in the evening - for dinner or at the cinema - I've noticed you have to wait a long time for a bus - there aren't that many.

Man: OK, thanks. So now i'd like to ask you about your car use.

sadie: Well, I have got a car but I don't use it that often. Mainly just to go to the supermarket. But that's about it really. My husband uses it at the weekends to go to the golf club.

Man: And what about a bicycle?

sadie: I don't actually have one at the moment.

Man: What about the city bikes you can rent? Do you ever use those?

sadie: No - I'm not keen on cycling there because of all the pollution. But I would like to get a bike - it would be good to have use it to get to work.

Man: So why haven't you got one now?

sadie: Well, I live in a flat - on the second floor and it doesn't have any storage - so we'd have to leave it in the hall outside the flat. 嗯，我住在二楼的一套公寓里，没有任何储物空间，所以我们不得不把它放在公寓外面的大厅里

Man: I see, OK, Well, I think that's all ...
