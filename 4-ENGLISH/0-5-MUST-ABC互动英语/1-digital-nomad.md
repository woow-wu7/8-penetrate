Nina used to have an office job. She would get up at seven. get to work by nine. go home after six.
It was a simple but boring life. Nina was unhappy with her life.
She wanted to see the world, but her job didn't let her do that.
So, she decided to become a digital nomad.
// She would get up at seven.
// Get to work by nine. 九点前上班
// Go home after six.
// -- get up. 起床
// -- get to work. 上班
// -- get off work. 下班
// -- go home. 回家

Now, Nina works while she travels.
// She can work at a poll, on the beach, or in a cafe.
// She can do that because her new office is her laptop.
