Episode 1: It Is Spring
--

"It's springtime!" shouted Mole. "Smell that fresh air!"
But my house is so dusty and dirt. I need a bucket, I need a mop, It's time to clean.
He stood on a ladder to dust a bookcase.
He moved a chair to clean under it.
He even polish the doorknobs. The kitchen is spotless! The pots and pans are all washed. The floor is next.
Back and forth Mole scrubbed the floor.
"ow!" he groaned. My back is sore. My arms are sore too.
Mole threw the scrub brush down. "Forget it!" he said. "Mole grabbed his coat."
He ran up a tunnel to the outside.
Up we go! Up we go!
Mole's head popped out of the hole.
"wow, the sun is bright!" Mole jumped out. "The grass smells sweet".
He rolled in the grass. He chased the butterflies
"This is so much better than cleaning" He ran across the meadow.
"stop" yelled an old rabbit.
"You must pay six pennies to run through here"
