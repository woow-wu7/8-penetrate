How do you choose a hotel?
You may pick a hotel by its star rating.
Hotels with two or there stars have small and simple rooms.
They also don't offer many services.

Five-star hotels are the best and the most expensive.
The rooms are large and have nice bathrooms.
They offer many services, too.
Book the hotel that's right for you. 预定适合你的酒店

Julie, take a look at this hotel room.
It looks very nice.
Are you going on a vacation soon?
No.  I'm going on a business trip tomorrow.
I'm trying to choose a hotel.
What is that hotel's star rating?
It's a four-star hotel, so it's a little expensive.
Well, both the room and the bathroom look really nice.
I think so, too.

What about that hotel?
The rooms look a little smaller than other ones.
You're right. The room looks simpler too.
This hotel is not as expensive. It only has three stars.
But, look, it has a swimming pool.
That's always nice.
And it has many good reviews. 它有很多好评
Maybe I'll book a room at this hotel.
