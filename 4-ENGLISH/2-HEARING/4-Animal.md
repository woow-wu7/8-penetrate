It is. It's a polar bear.
Polar bears look white, but they have black skin.
Really?
It soaks up the sun's light to keep them warm.
That interesting.
And polar bears can smell really well.
How well?
They can smell their favorite food about 16 kilometers away!

There are a lot of amazing animals in the world.
I know! Think about camels.
Yes. They can carry half their body weight for long distances.
I knew that.
And they don't need to drink water every day.
But when they do, they can drink 200 liters of water in just a few minutes.
