// read along 一起阅读 跟读

Alex tells Rob about military time.
They use a24-hour clock.
Rob thinks it's confusing.
Alex thinks it's easier. He doesn't have to worry about a.m and p.m.

Jim got mad at Taylor for being late.
They almost missed an important deadline.
They schedule has been tight this week. Rob is glad the weekend starts the day after tomorrow!

When you work at a TV station, things are always busy.
People are trying to make their shows quickly.
At the station you can't miss your deadline, so you have to work really fast.
That's why Jim mad at Taylor yesterday.
Like our Read It said, hopefully she isn't late agin.

It's not good to be late.
When you're late, people wait on you, and that makes them mad.
Friends, make sure you pay attention to our lesson.
There are lot of important things to learn about.

What time are we recording. Alex 我们什么时候录音。亚历克斯 // recording 纪律录音录像n // record 记录文字n
At 13:30. I'll meet you in the studio. // studio 演播室 录音室 制作室
What kind of time is that?
It's military time. It use a 24-hour clock. Time goes from 00:00-23:59. // military 军事的n
So do you say things like 13 o'clock?
You can, but most people just say 13 hundred.
Isn't that confusing? // confusing 令人困惑的adj
No, it's easier. You don't have to worry about a.m and p.m.!

Usually when you talk about time, you use the numbers one to twelve.
And if it's after midnight or in the morning, you say a.m.
If it's the afternoon or evening, you say p.m.
But today we are learning about military time.
Military time uses the number zero to 23:59. Then you don't worry about using a.m or p.m.
People just know that if you say a number after 12, you are talking about the afternoon.
so 13:30 is really 1:30 p.m. Or say it's 1:30 in the afternoon.
Friends, have you used this kind of time before? It can be a confusing, so it's good to practice using it.

Let's talk about the word "confusing". It's key word today.
Something confusing is hard to think about or do. Some people think math is confusing.

《confusing》
// But what do you think is confusing? You can tell someone else about that right now.
// And if you think something is confusing, you say you are confused about it.
// If you confused, ask someone a question and get some help.
// We don't want you to be confused when you're learning english, so that's why we're here to help you.

It's been a hard day.
Why has it been a hard day.
Jim got mad at me. I was late getting to the studio. // Jim声我的气
Everyone is late sometimes.
I know. But Jim and I had an important deadline. and because of me, we almost did't make it // 最后期限
But you did make it. And I won't be late ever again. 我再也不会迟到了
I've learned my lesson. 我受到教训了

If you saw yesterday's show, you know that Jim got mad at Taylor.
Do you remember why.
Oh, I do. She was late getting to the studio.
Remember? They only had the TV studio until half past two. So They had to hurry and finished their work.
And because Taylor was late getting to the studio, they almost missed their deadline.
That would have been a big problem. But let's talk about a new English phrase with xxxx right now.

When you are late doing something, that can cause some problems.
Taylor was late to the studio, and they almost missed their deadline.

《deadline》
// Your deadline is the day that you have to finish something.
// Sometimes teachers will tell you to write a paper. they give you a deadline. That deadline is the day you should turn in the paper
// If you have projects to do, your boss will tell you your deadline. So you have to finish your work by that deadline.

She feels bad that she was late getting to a recording, and she and Jim almost missed their deadline.
